agricheck
=========

A collection of checkpoints for inspections in the agri-food sector. [Here's an example of such an inspection point.](https://agriculture.ld.admin.ch/inspection/a3b3ff82-d2e3-2e36-83e0-3b546480ae08)

# The data model

The data model was written using OWL, the web ontology language. It is not only used as a map to write queries, but also for a automatic reasoning process. [You can inspect the data model here.](https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blw-ofag-ufag/agricheck/refs/heads/main/rdf/ontology.ttl)

# Example queries

- [Return the URI, name and level of each inspection point](https://s.zazuko.com/GA9HNb)
- [How many inspection points can we find under each inspection point group?](https://s.zazuko.com/24AEuhj)
- [Find inspection point groups with exactly one sub-item](https://s.zazuko.com/3pmApnf)
